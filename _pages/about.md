I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 
I am passionate about uncovering fundamental physical laws from the extensive observations of various astrophysical phenomena. 
My research areas include high-energy astrophysics, gravitational wave physics, and relativistic astrophysics.

Prior to my doctoral studies, my research focused on high-energy astrophysics, particularly in the domains of gamma-ray bursts and X-ray astronomy.
My doctoral work marks a transition from the electromagnetic to the gravitational-wave, expanding my focus to multi-messenger astronomy.
Through a unified approach of theory-informed and data-driven modeling, my work explores binary systems of stellar remnants. Particularly, emphasis on double white dwarf binaries, employing them as probes in multi-messenger studies.
The primary aim of my current research is to deepen our understanding of the Milky Way and its spiral arms, focusing on their structure and evolutionary history through the lens of multi-messenger astronomy.
