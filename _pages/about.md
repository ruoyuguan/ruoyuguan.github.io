I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I am passionate about uncovering fundamental physical laws from the extensive observations of various astrophysical phenomena. My research areas include high-energy astrophysics, gravitational wave physics, and relativistic astrophysics. 

‘’The time will come when diligent research over very long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject... and so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them.’’
                                                                        —Seneca, Naturales quaestions: Bks. Ⅶ Chap. 25
