I am a Ph.D. student in Physics (Thretical Physics) at the School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I am also affiliated with the Gravitational-Wave Physics Group at the National Gravitation Laboratory (NGL), HUST.

I am passionate about uncovering the fundamental physical laws of physics through extensive observations of diverse astrophysical phenomena. My research interests span high-energy astrophysics and gravitational wave physics.

Before beginning my doctoral studies, my work focused on high-energy astrophysics, particularly gamma-ray bursts and X-ray astronomy. My current research represents a shift from electromagnetic to gravitational-wave studies, broadening my perspective toward multi-messenger astronomy. Through a unified methodology that integrates physics-based modeling with statistical inference, I investigate binary systems of stellar remnants. My research focuses particularly on double white dwarf binaries, which serve as probes to deepen our understanding of the Milky Way's structure, spiral-arm morphology, and evolutionary history.
