I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I am passionate about uncovering fundamental physical laws from the extensive observations of various astrophysical phenomena. My research areas include high-energy astrophysics and gravitational wave physics.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I focused on high-energy astrophysics, with an emphasis on gamma-ray bursts and X-ray astronomy. My doctoral research represents a transition from electromagnetic to gravitational-wave studies, broadening my focus to multi-messenger astronomy. Through a unified approach combining theory-informed and data-driven modeling, I explore binary systems of stellar remnants, particularly focusing on double white dwarf binaries as probes to enhance our understanding of the Milky Way and its spiral arms, focusing on their structure and evolutionary history.
